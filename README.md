## Problem Statements:

1. Analyse the cases between the countries with lockdown and countries without lockdown. Also visualize the output.
[Here we have considered countries: Japan (No Lockdown) and Germany (Lockdown)]

2. Analyse the rate of change in cases in the country US before and after lockdown. US lockdown was imposed on April 1st, 2022. Also visualize the output.

3. US lockdown was imposed on April 1st, 2022. What would be the situation (change in number of cases per day) if the lockdown imposed before April 1st, 2022. Also visualize the output.

4. In India the partial lock down was imposed on March 25th to April 14th and complete lockdown was imposed on April 15th till May 3rd
Now analyse the following: <br />
a. The scenario from March to May if there was no lockdown imposed <br />
b. The scenario from March to May if there was only partial lockdown without imposing complete lockdown on April 15th. <br />
Also visualize the output for both the scenarios.
